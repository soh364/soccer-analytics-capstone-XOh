    "## 1. Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset Scale & Quality:** StatsBomb dataset contains **3,464 matches** (1958-2025) with **12.2M events** across 21 competitions. Data quality is exceptional with 99.25% location coverage, zero duplicate IDs, and comprehensive 35-event taxonomy. Core tactical events such as Pass, Carry, and Pressure represent 67% of all events—ideal for metric calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Women's Football Focus:** **504 women's matches** (14.5% of dataset) provide robust foundation: **326 FA WSL matches** for club baseline and **178 tournament matches** (62 UEFA Women's Euro, 116 FIFA Women's World Cup). Higher average goals/match (3.00 vs 2.83 men's) suggests more attacking play.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Temporal Concentration Challenge:** 53.7% of dataset is concentrated into 2015-2016 creating bias toward mid-2010s tactics. **Solution:** We focus exclusively on 2018-2025 women's data to capture modern tactical evolution and avoid historical bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Event Richness for Tactical Analysis:** Shot analysis reveals median xG of 0.055 (72.3% low-quality chances), suggesting dataset captures full spectrum from speculative shots to big chances. Pass completion (77.7%) and pressure events (20.9% under pressure) enable sophisticated possession and defensive metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Dashboard-Ready Data Structure:** Lineups data shows 32.5% actual playing time (vs 67.5% bench), enabling player-level minute-adjusted metrics. 141 countries represented, 10,803 unique players tracked—sufficient diversity for archetype clustering and comparative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Track Selection: **Track 2 - Deployed Soccer Analytics Dashboard**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Focus:** Tactical archetype identification and club-to-tournament translation patterns in women's football using 12 advanced event-based metrics.\n",

    "## 2. Data Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the official StatsBomb dataset provided via the capstone template repository. Data was downloaded using `download_data.py` following repository instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Files:**\n",
    "- `matches.parquet` - Match-level metadata (3,464 matches)\n",
    "- `events.parquet` - Event-level data (12.2M events, 17.8GB)\n",
    "- `lineups.parquet` - Player participation data (165K entries)\n",
    "- `reference.parquet` - Lookup tables (teams, players, positions)\n",
    "- `three_sixty.parquet` - 360° tracking data (9.3% coverage)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Focus Competitions for Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Club Baseline:**\n",
    "- FA Women's Super League: 326 matches (2018-2021)\n",
    "  - 3 seasons: 2018/19 (108), 2019/20 (87), 2020/21 (131)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tournament Data:**\n",
    "- UEFA Women's Euro: 62 matches (2022, 2025)\n",
    "- FIFA Women's World Cup: 116 matches (2023)\n",
    "- **Total tournaments:** 178 matches\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Dataset for Analysis:** 504 women's football matches\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Event Filtering:** Focus on tactical event types (Pass, Pressure, Carry, Shot, Duel)\n",
    "2. **Metric Calculation:** 12 tactical metrics computed via custom pipeline (see Section 4)\n",
    "3. **Aggregation:** Player-level metrics → Team-level metrics → Season-level profiles\n",
    "4. **Quality Checks:** Validated 99.25% location coverage, zero duplicate IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions & Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    "- StatsBomb event definitions are consistent across competitions\n",
    "- Missing player positions can be inferred from event patterns (20.6% missing)\n",
    "- Match context (home/away, competition importance) does not fundamentally alter tactical metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- **Temporal coverage:** Men's data heavily weighted to 2015-2016; women's data more recent (2018-2025)\n",
    "- **360 data:** Only 9.3% of matches have tracking data (limits packing metric to supplementary role)\n",
    "- **Playing time:** 67.5% of lineup entries are unused bench players (filtered in analysis)\n",
    "- **Selection bias:** StatsBomb focuses on top leagues/tournaments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on Dataset Composition\n",
    "\n",
    "The full StatsBomb dataset contains **2,960 men's matches** (85.5%) and **504 women's matches** (14.5%). While men's data offers rich comparative potential for future analysis, we focus exclusively on women's football for this deliverable to enable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Deep tactical profiling within a cohesive competitive ecosystem\n",
    "2. Novel insights in an under-analyzed domain\n",
    "3. Manageable scope for dashboard development within project timeline\n",
    "\n",
    "The men's dataset remains available for the comparative analysis in the final report. For complete men's football analysis, see **`EDA.ipynb` Section 2.5**.\n",
