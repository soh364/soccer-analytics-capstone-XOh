    "# Polymarket × StatsBomb Data Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook experiments with maching soccer prediction market data (Polymarket) to match event data (StatsBomb). The goal is to explore possible ways these datasets can be linked and to surface preliminary observaitons. It's mainly a sandbox for testing ideas and testing logic. Use the sections below to navigate the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymarket 2024\n",
    "- **1,054 markets** \n",
    "- **Market types:** Match outcomes, team futures, tournament winners, etc. \n",
    "- **Temporal:** Markets created 0-7 days before events\n",
    "- **Volume:** Total betting volume across markets (data available but not analyzed yet)\n",
    "\n",
    "### StatsBomb 2024\n",
    "- **153 matches** across 4 competitions\n",
    "- **Competitions:** UEFA Euro (51), AFCON (52), Copa America (32), Bundesliga (18)\n",
    "- **Coverage:** 88% international tournaments, 12% club matches\n",
    "- **Players:** 1,927 unique players across lineups\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why 2024?\n",
    "- Best temporal overlap: both datasets have substantial 2024 coverage\n",
    "- 2024 = tournament-heavy year (Euro, Copa America, AFCON) where Polymarket is most active\n",
    "- 2025 is incomplete and 2023 has fewer Polymarket markets \n",
    "\n",
    "## Matching Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Team Detection\n",
    "Fuzzy matching with strict guardrails:\n",
    "- **National teams:** Exact full name required (\"United States\" only, not \"USA\" or \"US\")\n",
    "- **Club teams:** Partial match on distinctive parts (\"Bayern\" → \"Bayern Munich\", \"Dortmund\" → \"Borussia Dortmund\")\n",
    "- **Common words excluded:** FC, United, City, Union (prevents \"Union Berlin\" matching \"Union Saint-Gilloise\")\n",
    "- **Multi-word clubs:** All distinctive parts required (prevents \"Borussia Mönchengladbach\" matching \"Borussia Dortmund\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Player Detection\n",
    "Strict matching to avoid false positives:\n",
    "- **2-name players:** Both names required (\"Lionel Messi\", not \"Messi\")\n",
    "- **3+ name players:** First + last name within 50 characters (\"Cristiano Ronaldo\" matches \"Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro\")\n",
    "- **No single-name matches:** Prevents \"Haaland\" matching \"Erling Haaland\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Match Statistics\n",
    "- 9 head-to-head (both teams detected) \n",
    "- 129 single-team (one team detected) \n",
    "- 15 player props \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tournament Bias \n",
    "88% of StatsBomb matches are international tournaments vs. 12% club. Limits generalizability to regular season club soccer. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:** \n",
    "- Clean match-to-market mappings for 130+ markets \n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**\n",
    "- No major leagues: Premier League, La Liga, Serie A absent \n",
    "- Small sample (130+) limits statistical power \n",
    "- Tournament-only bias \n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Match-level correlations:** xG vs. betting volume, possession vs. market odds\n",
    "2. **Team aggregations:** Total xG across all Argentina matches vs. \"Will Argentina win Copa America?\" market\n",
    "3. The datasets don't enable predictive modeling (sample too small) or cross-league comparisons (only 4 competitions)"

    "# Business Question\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the available data from Polymarket and StatsBomb 2024, we have three analyzable research questions across ***Copa America, UEFA Euro, and Bundesliga tournaments.***\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q1: Copa America Tournament Winner Market Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Question\n",
    "Do Polymarket tournament winner odds accurately reflect team quality as measured by aggregate xG performance throughout Copa America 2024?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "Markets may overprice offensive teams (high xG_for) while underpricing defensively solid teams (low xG_against), or vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "- **Markets:** 16 Copa America tournament winner markets + 1 Bundesliga market = **17 total**\n",
    "- **StatsBomb:** All Copa America 2024 matches (32 matches) + Bundesliga matches (18 matches)\n",
    "- **Metrics:** Aggregate team xG_for, xG_against, xG_diff, goals_for, goals_against across entire tournament\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "1. For each team in the 17 markets, calculate their total tournament performance:\n",
    "   - Sum xG across all their Copa/Bundesliga matches\n",
    "   - Calculate xG_diff (xG_for - xG_against)\n",
    "   - Get actual goals scored/conceded\n",
    "2. Extract final pre-tournament odds from Polymarket (implied win probability)\n",
    "3. Test correlation: Does xG_diff predict market odds?\n",
    "4. Identify mispriced teams: Where our xG model disagrees with market consensus\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Insights\n",
    "- Markets might undervalue defensive strength (xG_against matters)\n",
    "- Small-sample noise: A team's 4-5 tournament matches may not reflect true quality\n",
    "- Potential behavioral bias: Recency effect (group stage performance affecting knockout odds)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- Sample size: 17 markets (minimum viable)\n",
    "- Copa-heavy: 16/17 are Copa America, only 1 Bundesliga\n",
    "- No Euro tournament futures (Polymarket didn't offer them)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q2: UEFA Euro 2024 Player Top Scorer Market Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Question\n",
    "Are Polymarket \"top scorer\" and \"player of tournament\" odds efficiently priced relative to players' underlying xG generation rates?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "Markets may misprice players with high xG efficiency (xG/shot) vs. high volume shooters, or undervalue players on deep-run teams who accumulate more minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "- **Markets:** 28 Euro 2024 player prop markets (top scorer + player of tournament)\n",
    "- **StatsBomb:** All Euro 2024 matches (51 matches), player-level shot data\n",
    "- **Metrics:** Individual xG, xG/90 minutes, shots, goals, minutes played\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "1. For each player in the 28 markets:\n",
    "   - Calculate total xG accumulated in Euro 2024\n",
    "   - Calculate xG per 90 minutes (accounts for playing time)\n",
    "   - Get actual goals scored\n",
    "2. Project tournament xG: xG/90 × expected minutes (based on team progression)\n",
    "3. Convert projected xG to \"top scorer probability\" (simple model: higher xG = higher chance)\n",
    "4. Compare our model probability to Polymarket implied probability\n",
    "5. Calculate calibration: Did high-xG players actually score more goals?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Insights\n",
    "- Markets may overweight reputation (Ronaldo, Messi) vs. actual xG rates\n",
    "- Penalty takers might be overpriced (penalties inflate xG but are low-volume)\n",
    "- Players on tournament favorites get more minutes → more xG accumulation (smart markets price this in)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- xG → goals conversion has variance (a 2.0 xG player might score 0-5 goals)\n",
    "- Tournament progression uncertain: Deep runs = more minutes = more xG\n",
    "- \"Player of tournament\" markets harder to model (not just goals)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q3: Copa America Match-Level Exploratory Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Question (Exploratory)\n",
    "In the 6 Copa America matches with available markets, how well did pre-match Polymarket odds correlate with actual in-game xG generated?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "This is **NOT a statistical hypothesis test** as n=6 too small. Instead, it's a **case study analysis** to explore patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "- **Markets:** 6 Copa America match winner markets\n",
    "- **StatsBomb:** Match-level xG for home/away teams in those 6 specific matches\n",
    "- **Metrics:** Pre-match odds, home_xG, away_xG, actual score\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method\n",
    "1. For each of the 6 matches:\n",
    "   - Get pre-match Polymarket odds (implied win probabilities)\n",
    "   - Get actual xG generated by each team\n",
    "   - Compare: Did the team with better odds also generate more xG?\n",
    "2. Calculate simple metrics:\n",
    "   - Correlation between implied win prob and xG dominance\n",
    "   - Did favorites (by odds) outperform xG expectations?\n",
    "3. Narrative analysis: Describe interesting cases (e.g., odds favored Team A, but Team B dominated xG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Insights\n",
    "- Directional findings only (not statistically robust)\n",
    "- Identify if markets predicted xG dominance in these 6 matches\n",
    "- Document outliers for discussion (e.g., \"upset\" predictions)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Presentation\n",
    "- Frame as \"preliminary findings\" or \"illustrative examples\"\n",
    "- Acknowledge n=6 limitation upfront\n",
    "- Use for storytelling: \"In the Argentina vs. Colombia final, markets gave Argentina 65% odds, and they generated 2.1 xG vs 0.9 xG...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "- **Sample size: 6 matches is too small for statistical inference**\n",
    "- No control for score effects (losing teams shoot more → higher xG)\n",
    "- Pre-match odds vs. in-game xG comparison is noisy (luck, referee decisions, red cards)\n",

      "\n",
      " FINDING 1: Markets are highly efficient\n",
      "  - Strong correlation: r = 0.841 (R² = 0.707)\n",
      "  - xG explains 71% of market pricing variance\n",
      "  - Mean absolute mispricing: only 4.9%\n",
      "\n",
      " FINDING 2: Limited arbitrage opportunities\n",
      "  - Only 5 teams show >5% value edge\n",
      "  - Only 1 team overpriced by >5%\n",
      "  - Most 'value bets' are mid-tier teams (unclear if real edge)\n",
      "\n",
      " FINDING 3: Markets correctly price tournament favorites\n",
      "  - Argentina (winner): 65.5% odds with +8.58 xG_diff\n",
      "  - Appears 'overpriced' vs linear model, but actually correct\n",
      "  - Market incorporates non-linear effects and intangibles\n",
      "\n",
      " FINDING 4: Potential systematic bias\n",
      "  - Mid-tier teams (Mexico, USA) may be undervalued\n",
      "  - Market may overweight favorites, underweight contenders\n",
      "  - Need to verify against actual tournament results\n",
      "\n",
