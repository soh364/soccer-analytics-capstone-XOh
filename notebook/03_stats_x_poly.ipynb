    "# Polymarket × StatsBomb Data Matching\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook experiments with maching soccer prediction market data (Polymarket) to match event data (StatsBomb). The gola is to explore possible ways these datasets can be linked and to surface a few preliminary observaitons. It's mainly a sandbox for testing ideas and testing logic. Use the sections below to navigate the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polymarket 2024\n",
    "- **1,054 markets** \n",
    "- **Market types:** Match outcomes, team futures, tournament winners, etc. \n",
    "- **Temporal:** Markets created 0-7 days before events\n",
    "- **Volume:** Total betting volume across markets (data available but not analyzed yet)\n",
    "\n",
    "### StatsBomb 2024\n",
    "- **153 matches** across 4 competitions\n",
    "- **Competitions:** UEFA Euro (51), AFCON (52), Copa America (32), Bundesliga (18)\n",
    "- **Coverage:** 88% international tournaments, 12% club matches\n",
    "- **Players:** 1,927 unique players across lineups\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why 2024?\n",
    "- Best temporal overlap: both datasets have substantial 2024 coverage\n",
    "- 2024 = tournament-heavy year (Euro, Copa America, AFCON) where Polymarket is most active\n",
    "- 2025 is incomplete and 2023 has fewer Polymarket markets \n",
    "\n",
    "## Matching Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "### Team Detection\n",
    "Fuzzy matching with strict guardrails:\n",
    "- **National teams:** Exact full name required (\"United States\" only, not \"USA\" or \"US\")\n",
    "- **Club teams:** Partial match on distinctive parts (\"Bayern\" → \"Bayern Munich\", \"Dortmund\" → \"Borussia Dortmund\")\n",
    "- **Common words excluded:** FC, United, City, Union (prevents \"Union Berlin\" matching \"Union Saint-Gilloise\")\n",
    "- **Multi-word clubs:** All distinctive parts required (prevents \"Borussia Mönchengladbach\" matching \"Borussia Dortmund\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Player Detection\n",
    "Strict matching to avoid false positives:\n",
    "- **2-name players:** Both names required (\"Lionel Messi\", not \"Messi\")\n",
    "- **3+ name players:** First + last name within 50 characters (\"Cristiano Ronaldo\" matches \"Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro\")\n",
    "- **No single-name matches:** Prevents \"Haaland\" matching \"Erling Haaland\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Match Statistics\n",
    "- 9 head-to-head (both teams detected) \n",
    "- 129 single-team (one team detected) \n",
    "- 15 player props \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tournament Bias \n",
    "88% of StatsBomb matches are international tournaments vs. 12% club. Limits generalizability to regular season club soccer. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:** \n",
    "- Clean match-to-market mappings for 130+ markets \n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations**\n",
    "- No major leagues: Premier League, La Liga, Serie A absent \n",
    "- Small sample (130+) limits statistical power \n",
    "- Tournament-only bias \n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Match-level correlations:** xG vs. betting volume, possession vs. market odds\n",
    "2. **Team aggregations:** Total xG across all Argentina matches vs. \"Will Argentina win Copa America?\" market\n",
    "3. The datasets don't enable predictive modeling (sample too small) or cross-league comparisons (only 4 competitions)"
