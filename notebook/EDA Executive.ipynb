    "## 1. Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Findings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Temporal Bias Identified:** Men's football data shows **62.8% concentration in 2015/2016** (1,860/2,960 matches), creating severe tactical bias toward mid-2010s European football. Women's data (504 matches, 2018-2025) shows **0% concentration**—enabling modern tactical analysis without historical bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Gender-Specific Tactical Signals:** Women's football averages **3.00 goals/match vs 2.83 men's** (6% higher), suggesting different tactical dynamics. Men's data dominated by **top 5 European leagues** (2,442 matches, 82.5%), while women's provides **cohesive club-tournament ecosystem** (326 FA WSL + 178 tournaments).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Production-Ready Quality:** **99.25% location coverage** across 12.2M events, **zero duplicate IDs**, realistic distributions (77.7% pass completion, median xG 0.055). Data ready for 12-metric framework without preprocessing. 67% tactical event coverage (Pass, Carry, Pressure) provides rich signal for archetype clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Strategic focus on Women's Football:** 504 matches structured as **326 FA WSL (club baseline)** + **178 tournaments (Euro + World Cup)** = ideal for club→tournament tactical translation study. Modern coverage (2018-2025) captures current tactical evolution. Under-analyzed domain enables novel contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Men's Football for comparative analysis:** Men's tournament data comprehensive (147 matches: World Cup, Euro, Copa America) enables future comparative analysis: \"Do men's and women's teams exhibit same tactical compression from club→tournament?\" Hypothesis: Different archetype translation patterns by gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Track Selection: **Track 2 - Deployed Soccer Analytics Dashboard**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Focus:** Tactical archetype identification and club-to-tournament translation patterns in women's and men's football, and cross-gender comparative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverable:** Interactive dashboard enabling tactical profiling across 12 advanced metrics (Possession, Progression, Defensive dimensions).\n",

    "### Sources\n",
    "**StatsBomb Open Data** \n",
    "- We use the official StatsBomb dataset provided via the capstone template repository. Data was downloaded using `download_data.py` following repository instructions.\n",
    "- 5 datasets: matches, events, lineups, reference, three_sixty\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Files:**\n",
    "- `matches.parquet` - Match-level metadata (3,464 matches)\n",
    "- `events.parquet` - Event-level data (12.2M events, 17.8GB)\n",
    "- `lineups.parquet` - Player participation data (165K entries)\n",
    "- `reference.parquet` - Lookup tables (teams, players, positions)\n",
    "- `three_sixty.parquet` - 360° tracking data (9.3% coverage)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing\n",
    "- **Event Filtering:** Focus on tactical event types (Pass, Pressure, Carry, Shot, Duel)\n",
    "- **Metric Calculation:** 12 tactical metrics computed via custom pipeline `run_pipeline.py`\n",
    "- **Aggregation:** Player-level metrics → Team-level metrics → Season-level profiles\n",
    "- **Quality Checks:** Validated 99.25% location coverage, zero duplicate IDs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Assumptions\n",
    "- StatsBomb event definitions consistent across competitions\n",
    "- Missing positions (20.6%) inferred from event patterns during metric calculation\n",
    "- Tournament context (knockout pressure) captured through match-level analysis, not event-level flags\n",
    "\n",
    "### Known Limitations\n",
    "- **360° tracking data:** Only 9.3% of matches have tracking data, limits packing metric to supplementary role\n",
    "- **Selection bias:** StatsBomb focus on elite competitions only (top leagues/tournaments)\n",
    "- **Temporal scope:** Men's data heavily weighted to 2015-2016 while women's data more recent in 2018-2025\n",

    "- **Problem:** 52.7% in 2015/2016 = any \"football insights\" are actually \"mid-2010s football insights\"\n",
    "- **Implication:** Archetype clustering would be dominated by outdated tactical patterns\n",

    "### Research Question\n",
    "\n",
    "**How do tactical systems translate from club to tournament play in women's football?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We hypothesize \"tactical compression\" occurs in tournaments:\n",
    "- Shorter possession sequences (fatigue, pressure)\n",
    "- Higher PPDA (less aggressive pressing)\n",
    "- Lower defensive lines (risk aversion)\n",
    "- Fewer progressive actions (conservative play)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12-Metric Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Our metrics span three tactical dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possession (Control Quality):**\n",
    "1. Possession % — Team control\n",
    "2. Field Tilt — Territorial dominance\n",
    "3. Possession Value (EPR) — Quality over quantity\n",
    "4. Sequence Length — Patient vs direct play\n",
    "\n",
    "**Progression (Forward Movement):**\n",
    "5. Progressive Passes — 10+ yards toward goal\n",
    "6. Progressive Carries — Dribbling advancement\n",
    "7. Progressive Actions — Combined metric\n",
    "8. Packing* — Opponents eliminated (*360° limited)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Defensive (Pressing & Structure):**\n",
    "9. PPDA — Pressing intensity\n",
    "10. High Turnovers — Gegenpressing success\n",
    "11. Defensive Line Height — High line vs deep block\n",
    "12. Defensive Actions by Zone — Spatial distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Tactical Archetypes\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on metric combinations, we expect 4-6 archetypes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dominant Possession** — High Poss%, Field Tilt, Long Sequences, Low PPDA\n",
    "2. **High Press Counter** — Med Poss%, High Prog Carries, Very Low PPDA, High Turnovers\n",
    "3. **Deep Block Counter** — Low Poss%, Short Sequences, High PPDA, Low Def Line\n",
    "4. **Mid-Block Control** — High Poss%, Balanced Progression, Medium PPDA\n",
