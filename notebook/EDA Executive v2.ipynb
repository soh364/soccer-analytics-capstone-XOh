    "\n",
    "### Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recent tournament data is available and usable:** StatsBomb covers 466 international tournament matches from 2022–2025 (2022 World Cup, 2024 Euros, 2024 Copa América, 2025 Women's Euro), giving us modern, tactically relevant data directly preceding the 2026 cycle.\n",
    "- **All 8 tactical dimensions are fully computable:** Every metric in our team profiling framework (PPDA, Field Tilt, Possession %, Progression Ratio, xG Buildup, Defensive Line Height, xG Totals, and EPR) maps cleanly to available event types with no data gaps.\n",
    "- **Player trajectories are trackable across time:** 10,808 unique players appear across multiple seasons, enabling decay-weighted quality scoring and forward projection to 2026.\n",
    "- **Tactical diversity is real and separable:** Preliminary heatmap analysis confirms meaningful variation across all 8 dimensions allowing us to perform K-means clustering into 6–8 archetypes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Deliverable Path\n",
    "\n",
    "**Track 2: Deployed Soccer Analytics Dashboard**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our EDA confirms the dataset supports a fully interactive dashboard built on three pillars:\n",
    "1. **Tactical DNA** — cluster teams into 6–8 archetypes using 8 tactical dimensions\n",
    "2. **Player Quality** — compute decay-weighted scores across 10 position-specific dimensions\n",
    "3. **2026 Predictions** — forecast Men's World Cup & Women's Euro outcomes using the above\n",

    "\n",
    "| Dataset | Format | Description |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Matches | Parquet/CSV | Match metadata — competition, season, teams, score, date |\n",
    "| Events | Parquet/CSV | 12.2M event-level rows — passes, shots, pressures, carries, etc. |\n",
    "| Lineups | Parquet/CSV | Player-match lineups with positions |\n",
    "| 360° Frames | Parquet/CSV | Freeze-frame tracking (select matches only) |\n",
    "\n",
    "Data was downloaded by running `download_data.py` per the root `README.md`, then read locally from `data/Statsbomb/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preprocessing Steps\n",
    "- No joins performed at EDA stage and each file analyzed independently using template utilities\n",
    "- Event type labels extracted from nested JSON-style fields via `eda_starter_template.py` helper functions\n",
    "- Tournament matches filtered by competition name to isolate international data from club fixtures\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions & Limitations\n",
    "- StatsBomb open data skews toward elite competitions and tactical patterns from lower leagues are unrepresented\n",
    "- 360° freeze frame data is sparse with select matches only and excluded from primary metrics\n",
    "- Player projections assume stylistic consistency with major injuries, managerial changes, or positional shifts are not modeled"
