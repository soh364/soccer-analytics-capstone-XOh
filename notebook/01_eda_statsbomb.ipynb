    "# Soccer Analytics - Data Exploration Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook loads the StatsBomb Parquet extracts, inspects the main tables (matches, events, lineups, three-sixty, reference), and performs basic data-quality checks and small exploratory analyses. Use the sections below to navigate the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "StatsBomb football event data across five datasets: matches, events, lineups, reference, and three_sixty. Coverage spans 1958-2025 but heavily concentrated in 2015-2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matches\n",
    "- **3,464 matches** across 21 competitions\n",
    "- **Temporal:** 54% concentrated in 2015-2016 (1,860 matches). Pre-2015: 425 scattered matches. Post-2016: 1,179 matches over 8 years.\n",
    "- **Competitions:** La Liga 25%, Ligue 1 13%, Premier League 12%, Serie A 11%, Bundesliga 10%. Women's football 9.4%.\n",
    "- **Outcomes:** 45.2% home wins, 23.0% draws, 31.8% away wins. 2.85 goals/match average.\n",
    "- **Quality:** No duplicate IDs. Missing data limited to non-essential fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Events\n",
    "- **12,188,949 events** across 3,464 matches\n",
    "- **Distribution:** Pass 27.8%, Ball Receipt 26.0%, Carry 21.6%, Pressure 9.1%, Shot 0.7%\n",
    "- **Barcelona bias:** 10.2% of all events. Top 10 players all Barcelona 2010s (Messi, Busquets, Xavi, Iniesta).\n",
    "- **Shot quality:** 9,383 total xG across 88,023 shots (0.107 avg). Only 8.1% qualify as big chances (xG > 0.3). Median 0.055 suggests many speculative efforts.\n",
    "- **Passes:** 77.7% completion rate\n",
    "- **Temporal:** 50.4% first half, 49.2% second half\n",
    "- **Quality:** No duplicate IDs. 99.25% have location data. 20.9% under pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lineups\n",
    "- **165,820 entries** across 3,464 matches\n",
    "- **Participation:** Only 32.5% actually played (53,883). Remaining 67.5% are unused squad listings.\n",
    "- **Substitutions:** 6.2 avg per match. Starters 63.0 min avg, substitutes 13.4 min avg.\n",
    "- **Playing time:** 2.1% played 90+ min, 39.2% played 60-90 min, 22.8% played 30-60 min, 25.2% under 15 min.\n",
    "- **Cards:** 19,606 total (11.8%). 92.9% yellow. Busquets leads with 130.\n",
    "- **Geography:** 141 countries. Spain 14.6%, France 9.1%, England 8.5%.\n",
    "- **Quality:** 33,919 duplicate (match_id, player_id) pairs (20.4%), likely position changes not errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference\n",
    "- **9,566 rows** in 6 lookup tables\n",
    "- **Tables:** country (141), event_type (35), play_pattern (9), player (9,043), position (26), team (312)\n",
    "- All ID columns unique. Five duplicate player names, four duplicate team names (different entities, same name).\n",
    "- Team table has gender info (male/female), only populated extra_info field.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three_Sixty\n",
    "- **15,584,040 frames**\n",
    "- **Coverage:** Only 9.3% of matches (323/3,464)\n",
    "- **Competitions:** Tournament-focused. UEFA Euro 100%, Women's Euro 95%, but only 10% Bundesliga. No La Liga/PL/Serie A coverage.\n",
    "- **Temporal:** All 2020-2025, zero overlap with dense 2015-2016 period.\n",
    "- **Frames:** 50% teammate, 6.6% actor, 2.3% keeper. All have location + visible area polygons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Imbalances\n",
    "Barcelona represents 10% of events, top 10 players all 2010s Barcelona. Reflects 2015-2016 spike. Limits generalization beyond Barcelona/La Liga.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Temporal Concentration\n",
    "2015-2016 contains 54% of matches despite 2 years in 67-year span. Any \"football\" conclusions actually \"mid-2010s European football\" conclusions. Temporal imbalance severe enough to treat 2015-2016 as separate cohort.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Completeness\n",
    "Core events excellent (99.25% location, zero duplicates). Lineups problematic (67.5% non-participants). 360 limited (9.3% matches, zero overlap with dense period).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shot Quality\n",
    "8.1% big chances (xG > 0.3), median 0.055. Either many low-probability shots or poor chance creation. Needs careful interpretation vs. league-wide benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "- No duplicate IDs in matches/events\n",
    "- 99%+ location coverage\n",
    "- Complete timestamps\n",
    "- 35 event types\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- 54% temporal concentration\n",
    "- Barcelona/La Liga bias\n",
    "- 67.5% lineups are non-participants\n",
    "- 9.3% 360 coverage\n",
    "- Missing values in optional fields\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset characteristics suggest several points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Representativeness:** Barcelona/La Liga overweight means \"football\" conclusions actually weighted toward one team's 2010s style. Consider stratifying by competition or limiting scope explicitly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Temporal:** 2015-2016 dominates. Time-series models will struggle with sparse pre/post data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **360 data:** 9.3% coverage, tournament-only, no overlap with dense period. Not suitable for systematic analysis. Case studies only.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Lineups:** 67.5% non-participants. Filter to actual playing time before use. 20.4% duplicates need investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **xG patterns:** Median 0.055 suggests dataset-specific shooting patterns or selection bias. Comparisons to other providers may not align."
