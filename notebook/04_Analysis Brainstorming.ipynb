    "1. **Market Efficiency**: Do betting odds accurately predict match outcomes?\n",
    "2. **Live Event Impact**: How do goals affect betting odds in real-time?\n",
    "3. **Betting Volume Patterns**: Which teams attract the most betting interest?\n",
    "4. **xG vs Market Odds**: Can Expected Goals models identify value bets?\n",
    "5. **Playing Style Mispricing**: Do markets correctly price different team styles?\n",
    "\n",
    "Each analysis includes:\n",
